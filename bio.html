                <p>I’m a systems thinker. I understand people through the lens of their relationships, past and present. From my original training in family systems theory and my early work in hospice bereavement service, suicide prevention and other crisis modalities, I’ve ranged broadly in my own explorations of personal meaning and how it’s imaginally constituted. In crisis and bereavement work I learned the power of witness, to sit with people without trying to “fix” the pain of a tragic experience. That was terrific training in talking, listening and staying close to what’s true. Since then, I’ve spent 15 years as a couples and individual therapist in private practice. I’m a longtime member of a professional supervision group run by Esther Perel, LMFT and her thinking has been tremendously impactful in my outlook and work with couples. I’ve served as the Clinical Director for two different Marriage and Family training practices, providing clinical supervision and running the training program for dozens of post masters trainees. I have advanced training in various modalities, including extensive training in RLT(Relational Life Therapy), Prepare/Enrich, Discernment Counseling and Critical Incident Stress Debriefing. I have a working knowledge of Imago and The Gottman Method and use many of those techniques. But beyond my professional background, my own passions and life experience come into the room a lot. Parenthood, an informal and extroverted style, my past as a poet and professor of literature– as well as film, rock music and visual art–have been deeply influential in my thinking as a therapist. The thing that art and relational psychotherapy has in common is the compassionate awareness that we are not alone. In my work with clients, I make space for the philosophical, the intuitive and their intersection: the things we know without reason.</p>
